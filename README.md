## Details

In this project I created my own smart contract from scratch using solidity and forge.
On the front end, I used React, Typescript and Css.

## How to use

Users should connect their wallets to access their own contact books.
Initially contact book will be empty. They should click on the add contact button and then enter the required information.
Then they should have the gas fee information before they add the contact on their contact book.
They can also remove contacts from their contact books by pressing the remove button.



## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template next-typescript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `pages/_app.tsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add environment variables. Check the `.env.example` file for all the environment variables required and add it to `.env.local` file or set them up on your hosting provider.

## Deploy to IPFS

Deploy a copy of your application to IPFS using the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
